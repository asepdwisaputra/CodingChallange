```plaintext
Jake is a very habitual person. He eats breakfast at 7:00 a.m. each morning, lunch at 12:00 p.m. and dinner at 7:00 p.m. in the evening.

Create a function that takes in the current time as a string and determines the duration of time before Jakeâ€™s next meal. Represent this as an array with the first and second elements representing hours and minutes, respectively.

Examples:

timeToEat('2:00 p.m.') -> [5, 0]
// 5 Hour until the next meal, dinner

timeToEat('5:50 a.m.') -> [1, 10]
// 1 Hour and 10 minutes until the next meal, breakfast
```
